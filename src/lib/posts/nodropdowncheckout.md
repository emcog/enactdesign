F**k drop downs. A checkout inspired by Golden Krishna and Eric Campbell. 
Krishna is a design strategist and author at Google so I didn't think too hard about questioning his logic 

Krishna and Campbell's talk is entertaining and their premise is simple Drop downs are deeply flawed and there is always a better option. 

I decided to put this idea to test and design a checkout without drop downs.
