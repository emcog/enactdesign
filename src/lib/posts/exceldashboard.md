excerpt: Custom dashboard built in excel
---

I recently built a dashboard for one of the big-four accountancy firms. This is used to help them visualise
savings by using a global team rather than a local team. It takes inputs and creates graphs which update 
in real-time.

This was used to give staff an impression of the cost savings if they used a larger more complex application
purpose built. There had been resistance in using the new software. Excel is a commonly used tool, so it faced
relatively low-friction in staff picking it up.


The design and implementation of the project followed as many softward development conventions as possible.
e.g. Separation of concerns and visible tests. Excel doesn't have state, so I was constrained in what I could 
visualise. I applied principles of form design too so that inputs were highlighted and only they were editable.

Understandably, this project is under NDA so I can't share a visualisations of it.
