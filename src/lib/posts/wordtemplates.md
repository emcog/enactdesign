excerpt: Custom word documents to bring inter and intra comms on brand and increased efficicency

What is a word template?
A word template is a custom document designed to keep your inter and intra comms on brand.

Why do you use a word template?
Consistency and speed
By keeping it on brand messaging stays consistent in look and feel, reducing the number of choices a staff member can make.
Choices are bad because you want staff to focus on content and avoid them wasting time playing with design for the sake of it.

What is a useable word template?
A useable template makes the most of the native features of word. For example, pre-defined styles with meaningful nomeclature.
Usually a short handover session (5-20) minutes can set you up to get the most from your template. 

How do you design a word template?
I can follow brand guidelines or detailed designs done elsewhere, e.g. Indesign or Illustrator. If you don't have brand guidelines that not a problem either.
