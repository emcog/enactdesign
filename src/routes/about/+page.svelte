<h1>Enactivism</h1>
<p>
Our knowledge is embedded in our body, environment and relationships.
Technology which is difficult to use or, worse addictive consumes our time, patience and attention.
We go the extra mile to understand complexity and create systems and components which are simple to understand and use
So that we can focus on the things that matter
